# pl-matches-predictions

This project scrapes the data from fbref.com by inspecting its html/css elements and then reads it into a pandas dataframe. Further we use this dataframe in our jupyter notebook. We analyze the dataframe, clean it and then use the Random Forest Algorithm to predict if the team wins a premier league match or not.

Scraping data from a website involves programmatically accessing the website's HTML and CSS code and extracting the relevant data. This data can be structured in a tabular form using a library like Pandas. Once the data is in a Pandas dataframe, it can be analyzed, cleaned, and pre-processed for machine learning purposes.

Random Forest is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. It works by building multiple decision trees and then combining their predictions to make a final prediction. In this case, the goal is to predict whether a team wins or not based on various features such as the number of shots, passes, and tackles.

Overall, this project is a mix of web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning techniques.
